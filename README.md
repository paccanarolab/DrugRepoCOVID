This repository contains the code to reproduce approach 1.

**Training models**. Matlab notebook that allows to train the models, including competitors, as presented in the paper. To run the code, you need to run each cell inside the notebook in the order in which they appear. The training of some models can take longer, depending of computational resources. 

**Performance evaluation**. Matlab notebook that reads the results of all the models, and generates the performance plot shown in the paper.
